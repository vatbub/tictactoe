# TicTacToe
This is another implementation of the tic tac toe game. While I already implemented a crappy version to learn how the MiniMax Algorithm works, I finally decided to rewrite everything with all the knowledge in mind that I (hopefully) acquired over time.

The AI it uses plays perfectly meaning that you cannot win against it, however you can set the skill level of the AI to actually have a chance to win and have some fun.

## Download the standalone app
